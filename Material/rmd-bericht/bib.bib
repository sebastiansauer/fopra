@article{Roberts2007,
abstract = {The ability of personality traits to predict important life outcomes has traditionally been questioned because of the putative small effects of personality. In this article, we compare the predictive validity of personality traits with that of socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive ability to test the relative contribution of personality traits to predictions of three critical outcomes: mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment. Only evidence from prospective longitudinal studies was considered. In addition, an attempt was made to limit the review to studies that controlled for important background factors. Results showed that the magnitude of the effects of personality traits on mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment was indistinguishable from the effects of SES and cognitive ability on these outcomes. These results demonstrate the influence of personality traits on important life outcomes, highlight the need to more routinely incorporate measures of personality into quality of life surveys, and encourage further research about the developmental origins of personality traits and the processes by which these traits influence diverse life outcomes. },

@article{Mazar2008,
abstract = {People like to think of themselves as honest. However, dishonesty pays?and it often pays well. How do people resolve this tension? This research shows that people behave dishonestly enough to profit but honestly enough to delude themselves of their own integrity. A little bit of dishonesty gives a taste of profit without spoiling a positive self-view. Two mechanisms allow for such self-concept maintenance: inattention to moral standards and categorization malleability. Six experiments support the authors' theory of self-concept maintenance and offer practical applications for curbing dishonesty in everyday life.},

@article{Sauer2015b,
abstract = {Whereas the number of studies supporting the efficacy of mindfulness as a health intervention is increasing, the measurement of mindfulness remains a subject of debate. Given the importance of measurement in this field, this paper aims to further our understanding of the assessment of mindfulness by employing an approach referred to as ?random forests? (RF). RF is an ensemble learning method that is based on decision trees. RF is well known in biological research, for example, but is practically unknown in psychometrics. In this study, RF was used to gauge the predictive validity of the items from two mindfulness instruments concerning their ability to estimate group allocation (i.e., mindfulness practitioners vs. nonpractitioners). To allow for a better generalization of the results, we examined the research questions in two samples (N=76 and N=202) of different quality. We investigated two instruments: the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) and the Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale. Although results indicated that both instruments were capable of distinguishing practitioners from nonpractitioners, the predictive quality of most items on both scales was determined to be insufficient.},
